## Rosling solution sender +

Solution to simlify problem submission to http://rosalind.info. 

Rough plan is:

* Automate getting data set and result submisssion (done in first draft).
* Move user data in submission config in separate config.
* Form unit test for solution base on submission result.
* Organise problem solvers and submission using dependensy injection.
* Select and send problem solution code with submission.
